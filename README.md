Alchemy Coffee and Bookstore website

This is my first project as part of my studies of full stack software development with Code Institute. It is a website for a coffee and bookshop called Alchemy, based in Cork City, Ireland. The purpose of this website is to contribute towards higher sales and numbers of customers.
